# Pinecone Backend

The Pinecone backend stores embeddings in [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/), a fully managed vector database. Pinecone remains fully supported, but it is the optional managed-cloud path rather than the default production recommendation. If you want the recommended open-source production backend, use Qdrant.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Notes |
|---|---|
| Pinecone account | Free tier available at [pinecone.io](https://www.pinecone.io/) |
| API key | Found in the Pinecone console under "API Keys" |
| Index created | Create an index in the console or via the Pinecone API |
| Node.js 18+ | Uses native `fetch` (no SDK dependency) |

## Configuration

```typescript
import { PineconeVectorStore } from '@framers/agentos/rag/implementations/vector_stores/PineconeVectorStore';

const store = new PineconeVectorStore({
  id: 'my-pinecone',
  type: 'pinecone',
  apiKey: process.env.PINECONE_API_KEY!,
  indexHost: 'https://my-index-abc123.svc.aped-1234.pinecone.io',
  namespace: 'agent-default',
  defaultDimension: 1536,
});

await store.initialize();
```

### Configuration options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `apiKey` | `string` | **required** | Pinecone API key |
| `indexHost` | `string` | **required** | Data Plane URL for your index (from Pinecone console) |
| `namespace` | `string` | `''` | Default namespace; collections map to namespaces |
| `defaultDimension` | `number` | `1536` | Embedding dimensions (must match the index) |

The `indexHost` is the **Data Plane** endpoint for a specific index — not the control plane URL. Find it in the Pinecone console under your index details. It looks like `https://my-index-abc123.svc.aped-1234.pinecone.io`.

## Namespace-based collection isolation

Pinecone namespaces are used as "collections". Each namespace is fully isolated within the same index:

```typescript
// Agent A's memories
await store.upsert('agent-alice', documents);

// Agent B's memories — completely separate namespace
await store.upsert('agent-bob', documents);

// Query only Agent A's namespace
await store.query('agent-alice', embedding, { topK: 10 });
```

Namespaces are created implicitly on first upsert. `createCollection()` is a no-op.

## Metadata filtering

Pinecone supports MongoDB-style metadata filter operators. AgentOS translates its unified `MetadataFilter` format to Pinecone's native syntax:

```typescript
const results = await store.query('my-namespace', embedding, {
  topK: 10,
  filter: {
    type: { $eq: 'semantic' },        // Equality
    importance: { $gte: 0.5 },        // Range
    tags: { $in: ['project', 'decision'] }, // Set membership
  },
});
```

### Supported operators

| Operator | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `$eq` | Equal to | `{ status: { $eq: 'active' } }` |
| `$ne` | Not equal to | `{ status: { $ne: 'deleted' } }` |
| `$gt`, `$gte` | Greater than (or equal) | `{ score: { $gt: 0.8 } }` |
| `$lt`, `$lte` | Less than (or equal) | `{ age: { $lt: 30 } }` |
| `$in` | In set | `{ type: { $in: ['a', 'b'] } }` |
| `$nin` | Not in set | `{ type: { $nin: ['x'] } }` |
| `$exists` | Field exists | `{ tags: { $exists: true } }` |

Metadata values must be string, number, boolean, or string arrays. Complex objects are JSON-stringified before storage.

## Limitations

### No hybrid search

Pinecone requires a separate sparse encoder (e.g., SPLADE) for hybrid search. The AgentOS `hybridSearch()` method falls back to dense-only search on Pinecone. For true hybrid search, use the Postgres or Qdrant backends.

### No knowledge graph

There is no sidecar storage for knowledge graph data. If you enable `graph: true` in `MemoryConfig` with the Pinecone backend, graph data is not persisted.

### Not self-hostable

Pinecone is a managed service only. You cannot run it on your own infrastructure. If self-hosting is a requirement, use Qdrant or Postgres.

### Batch size limit

Pinecone limits upserts to 100 vectors per request. AgentOS handles this automatically by splitting batches, but large ingestion jobs will make many sequential API calls.

### No `deleteAll` count

`delete({ deleteAll: true })` returns `deletedCount: -1` because Pinecone's API does not report how many vectors were deleted in a bulk operation.

## Migration FROM Pinecone to self-hosted backends

Use the AgentOS migration engine to move data from Pinecone to Postgres or Qdrant:

```typescript
import { MigrationEngine } from '@framers/agentos/rag/migration/MigrationEngine';

await MigrationEngine.migrate({
  from: {
    type: 'pinecone',
    // PineconeSourceAdapter uses indexHost + apiKey + namespace
    url: 'https://my-index-abc123.svc.aped-1234.pinecone.io',
    apiKey: process.env.PINECONE_API_KEY!,
  },
  to: {
    type: 'postgres',
    connectionString: 'postgresql://postgres:wunderland@localhost:5432/agent_memory',
  },
  batchSize: 100,
  onProgress: (done, total, table) => {
    console.log(`[${table}] ${done}/${total}`);
  },
});
```

The migration reads vectors via Pinecone's `list` + `fetch` APIs and writes them to the target backend. Non-vector data (knowledge graph, conversations) is not stored in Pinecone and will not be migrated.

## Cost comparison

| Tier | Vectors | Monthly cost | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Starter (free)** | 100K | $0 | 1 index, 1 project, community support |
| **Standard** | 1M+ | ~$70+ | Multiple indexes, backup, 99.95% SLA |
| **Enterprise** | 10M+ | Custom | Dedicated infra, HIPAA, SOC2 |

Self-hosted alternatives for comparison:

| Backend | Vectors | Monthly cost | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Postgres + pgvector** | 10M+ | ~$15 (Neon free) to ~$50 (RDS) | Full SQL, hybrid search included |
| **Qdrant (Docker)** | 10M+ | Cost of your VM (~$5-20) | Built-in BM25, quantization |
| **Qdrant Cloud** | 1M+ | ~$25+ | Managed Qdrant, auto-scaling |

Pinecone is the easiest managed path to start with but becomes expensive at scale. For production agents processing large knowledge bases, Postgres or Qdrant usually offer better cost efficiency and more features, and Qdrant is the default OSS production recommendation.
